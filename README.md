# Supermarket Sales Database Management System

## Overview
The "Supermarket Sales Database Management System" project, designed for the Information Systems Engineering (IEE 505) course, harnesses the power of advanced data analytics and machine learning to revolutionize the way supermarkets manage and analyze their sales data. This project aims to provide actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency by building a robust data infrastructure and applying sophisticated predictive analytics.

## Detailed Visualizations and Model Outputs

### 1. Entity-Relationship (E-R) Model

- **Description**: The Entity-Relationship diagram represents the comprehensive database schema designed to manage intricate relationships between different data entities such as Products, Invoices, Branches, and Customers. This diagram serves as the architectural blueprint for implementing a relational database that supports complex data queries necessary for advanced analytics.
- **Inference**: The E-R model underpins the database’s ability to handle multifaceted data interactions, ensuring data integrity and scalability. It facilitates detailed analyses such as sales tracking, customer relationship management, and inventory control, all critical for strategic decision-making.

### 2. MySQL Database Setup

- **Description**: This snippet shows the SQL code used for creating and populating database tables specific to the supermarket context. It includes commands for defining primary keys, which ensure data uniqueness and relational integrity.
- **Inference**: Demonstrates the initial steps in transforming the conceptual database design into a functional data storage system. This setup is crucial for supporting real-time data entry and retrieval operations, which form the backbone of dynamic business analytics.

### 3. Inventory Analysis

- **Description**: A bar chart visualizes the inventory levels across various product categories, providing a clear snapshot of stock distribution.
- **Inference**: This analysis helps in inventory management by identifying categories that may require restocking or overstocked items that need promotional sales strategies. It aids in optimizing stock levels to meet customer demand without overcapitalizing on inventory.

### 4. Sales Distribution Analysis

- **Description**: The distribution of total sales across branches is depicted in both bar and pie chart formats, offering both absolute and relative perspectives of sales performance.
- **Inference**: These insights are instrumental in benchmarking branch performance against sales targets, guiding resource allocation, and tailoring branch-specific marketing strategies to enhance profitability.

### 5. Sales Variability Analysis

- **Description**: This boxplot details the variability and distribution of sales across different branches, highlighting outliers and the spread of sales data.
- **Inference**: Useful for identifying branches with inconsistent sales patterns, which may indicate operational issues or market volatility. Strategic interventions can then be designed to stabilize and enhance branch performance.

### 6. Product Performance Heatmap

- **Description**: A heatmap provides a visual representation of sales volume across different product lines and branches, using color intensity to signify sales magnitude.
- **Inference**: Enables managers to quickly identify high-performing products and potential areas for improvement. Insights from the heatmap can drive product placement strategies, promotional campaigns, and even product development initiatives.

### 7. Machine Learning Model Evaluation
![Model Performance](path/to/model_performance.png)
- **Description**: Evaluation of various regression models, highlighting the Random Forest model’s performance with an exceptional R² score.
- **Inference**: Validates the effectiveness of machine learning models in forecasting sales, which supports advanced inventory planning, demand forecasting, and financial planning.

### 8. Model Optimization through Hyperparameter Tuning
